Clone the repository: Open Git-Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to install the torrent searcher. Then run the following command to clone the repository:\n\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/<repository-url>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone. This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.\n\n3. Install dependencies: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using Git-Bash and install any required dependencies. This step may vary depending on the project you are installing. Look for a `README` file or documentation in the repository for specific instructions.\n\n4. Configure the torrent searcher: After installing the dependencies, you may need to configure the torrent searcher. Again, check the repository's documentation for any specific instructions on how to set it up.\n\n5. Run the torrent searcher: Once everything is set up, you can run the torrent searcher"

To unpack the tar file, use the `tar` command with the `x` (extract) option, `v` (verbose) option to display the progress, and `f` (file) option to specify the tar file. For example:\n   ```\n   tar -xvf filename.tar\n   ```\n   Replace `filename.tar` with the actual name of your tar file.\n\n4. The tar file will be extracted in the same directory.
